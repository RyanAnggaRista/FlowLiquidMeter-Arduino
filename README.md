# FlowLiquidMeter-Arduino
The sensor flow liquid meter consists of a plastic valve body, a water rotor, and a hall effect sensor. When air flows through the rotor, the rotor will rotate and the rotor speed will match the flow of air entering through the rotor. The pulse signal from the rotor will be received by the hall effect sensor and then processed in the microcontroller.
